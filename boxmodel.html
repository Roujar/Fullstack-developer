            Sport is a form of physical activity or game.[1] Often competitive and organized, sports use, maintain, or improve
             physical ability and skills. They also provide enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators.
             [2] Many sports exist, with different participant numbers, some are done by a single person with others being done by 
             hundreds. Most sports take place either in teams or competing as individuals. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", 
             in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner. A number of contests may be 
             arranged in a tournament format, producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a 
             regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.

            Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major
             competitions admitting only sports meeting this definition.[3] Some organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude 
             activities without any physical element from classification as sports.[2] However, a number of competitive, 
             but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee who oversee the Olympic 
             Games recognises both chess and bridge as sports. SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises
              five non-physical sports: chess, bridge, draughts, Go and xiangqi.[4][5]
